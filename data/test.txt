0	The transition period is meant to give both sides some breathing space while a new free trade agreement is negotiated.
1	Brexit is happening.  After three years of haggling in the British Parliament, convulsions at the top of the government and pleas for Brussels to delay its exit, Britain closes the book on nearly half a century of close ties with Europe on Jan. 31.
1	Mr. Johnson, a brash proponent of withdrawal, will now guide the country through the most critical stage of Brexit: trade negotiations that will determine how closely linked Britain remains with the bloc.
-1	Britain has been debating the pros and cons of membership in a European community of nations almost from the moment the idea was broached. It held its first referendum on membership in what was then called the European Economic Community in 1975, less than three years after it joined. At the time, 67 percent of voters supported staying in the bloc.
0	Brexit advocates had saved for another day the tangled question of what should come next. Even now that Britain has settled the terms of its departure, it remains unclear what sort of relationship with the European Union it wants for the future, a matter that could prove just as divisive as the debate over withdrawal.
1	Most voters in England and Wales supported Brexit, particularly in rural areas and smaller cities. That overcame majority support for remaining in the European Union among voters in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
-1	With some regularity, major businesses have announced that they are leaving Britain because of Brexit, or have at least threatened to do so. The list of companies thinking about relocating includes Airbus, which employs 14,000 people and supports more than 100,000 other jobs.
-1	Mrs. May had promised that Brexit would mean an end to free movement — that is, the right of people from elsewhere in Europe to live and work in Britain. Working-class people who see immigration as a threat to their jobs viewed that as a triumph. But an end to free movement would cut both ways, and the prospect was dispiriting for young Britons hoping to study or work abroad.
0	Before Parliament approved Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal agreement in January, just about the only clear decision it made on Brexit was to give formal notice in 2017 to quit, under Article 50 of the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty, a legal process setting it on a two-year path to departure. That made March 29, 2019, the formal divorce date.
-1	Two-thirds of Scots, including nearly half of those who voted for Brexit, want the withdrawal from the EU to be delayed while the country focuses on battling the coronavirus outbreak, according to a new poll.
-1	A three-month extension to Brexit was a relief to those in the UK who feared no deal or who still hope for no Brexit.
-1	Cameron vowed to campaign with his “heart and soul” to keep Britain in the bloc.
